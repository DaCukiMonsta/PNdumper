# PNdumper
A tool to dump Xbox 360 part numbers from a directory of NAND dumps. This information can then be contributed to the 360 part numbers community database project.

# How to Use
Download PNdumper.exe from the releases section of the GitHub repository. Then, either:
- Copy PNdumper.exe into your Jrunner folder and execute it, or
- Drag your Jrunner folder onto PNdumper.exe.

This assumes your Jrunner folder contains subfolders for each console with nanddump1.bin and cpukey.txt.

Once your resulting CSV file is created, please email it to 360partnumbers@gmail.com for processing. Thank you!

# Privacy Notice/Agreement
This notice is also included in the software - you must agree to it before use.

Thank you for considering contributing to our project. This tool collects information about the consoles you have NAND dumps for. This includes the console part/product number. We will use the part number in combination with other information to compile a public database of Xbox 360 part/product numbers. We believe the part number represents the specific retail configuration/SKU of your console at purchase. It is not personally idenitifiable or unique to you.

A console part number is of the form Xnnnnnn-001 where n can be any digit. However, this can only be extracted from your NAND. A similar part number appears on the console motherboard itself, however this is NOT the part number we are looking for at this time, it is always different and that the part number of the PCB itself.

This application will compile a CSV file for you to manually email to us. This application does not connect to the internet, and does not send any data to us unless you specifically decide to email the resulting file to us yourself.

Your provided information may be stored for research purposes, but will not be tied to you individually. Your console serial numbers will not be published under any circumstance, but may be used to privately research serial number formats. Other anonymised information such as your console part number (which is not unique) may be published as part of a public database of 360 part numbers. Before your results file is created, you will be given the option to censor/redact all serial numbers. Once your anonymised information is sent to us, we may not be able to delete it once it is added to the database.
